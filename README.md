The list of the Top LeetCode questions and Patterns.


1. Recursion
Defining a problem in terms of itself, often leading to elegant and concise solutions.

Solve: Factorial calculation, tree traversals, depth-first search.

2. Dynamic Programming
Breaking down a problem into overlapping subproblems and storing solutions to avoid recomputation.

Solve: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence.

3. Greedy Algorithms
Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

Implement: Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

4. Backtracking
Incrementally building solutions, exploring all possible paths, and abandoning invalid ones.

Solve: Sudoku solver, N-Queens problem, generating permutations.
